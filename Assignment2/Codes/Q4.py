Assignment Q4
Q4. Implement Bayes Classifier for Iris Dataset. 
Dataset Specifications: 
Total number of samples = 150
Number of classes = 3 (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor)
Number of samples in each class = 50 
Use the following information to design classifier: 
    Number of training feature vectors ( first 40 in each class) = 40
    Number of test feature vectors ( remaining 10 in each class) = 10
    Number of dimensions = 4
    Feature vector = <sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width>
If the samples follow a multivariate normal density, find the accuracy of classification for the test 
feature vectors.
