Q6. Consider the 128- dimensional feature vectors given in the “face feature vectors.csv” file.
Use this information to design and implement a Bayes Classifier.
Dataset Specifications:
Total number of samples = 800
Number of classes = 2 ( labelled as “male” and “female”)
Samples from “1 to 400” belongs to class “male”
Samples from “401 to 800” belongs to class “female”
Number of samples per class = 400
Use the following information to design classifier:
    Number of test feature vectors ( first 5 in each class) = 5
    Number of training feature vectors ( remaining 395 in each class) = 395
    Number of dimensions = 128
